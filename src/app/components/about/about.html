<legend>About Me</legend>

<p>
  I'm a software developer currently working in southwest Virginia. I love to make all sorts of things ranging from
  apps and arduino based temperature sensors, to home brewed beer & wine. If it has a purpose, an elegance,
  or a science - then I've most likely got an interest. I love trying out new things, and I'm not afraid to break
  them along the way. What better way to learn how to fix it?
