  <h1><a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/commit-cloud">Commit Cloud</a></h1>
  <p>
    Generate a word cloud using commit messages from public github repos. Commit Cloud Uses the github API
    (via <a href="https://github.com/philschatz/octokit.js">octokit</a>) to get the 100 most recent commit messages.
    It splits the messages into individual words and tracks the frequency of each word. It then generates the word
    cloud using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/lucaong/jQCloud">jQCloud</a>.
    See it in action <a href="https://lightswitch05.github.io/commit-cloud/">here</a>

  <h1><a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/gaussCrack">Gauss Crack</a></h1>
  <p>
    Gauss Crack was created in response to the <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/09/gauss-virus/#oKOJ1PsnZGqd">Gauss Virus</a>.
    The Gauss Virus contains an encrypted payload designed to target computers with a <em>very</em> specific
    configuration. In fact, the configuration is so specific, that the exact configuration required to decrypt
    the encrypted payload is still unknown! The virus employs a
    <a href="https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-the-encrypted-gauss-payload-5/">very novel algorithm</a>
    to ensure the payload stays encrypted until its needed. Gauss Crack mimics the algorithm in
    an attempt to find the correct configuration so the payload can finally be decrypted and analyzed.
    See the <a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/gaussCrack">algorithm</a>, or
    <a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/gaussCrack/blob/master/binaries/GaussCheck.zip">download</a> and test
    your system now.</p>

    <p>
      Clipster is an Open Source Rails engine to add clipboard code sharing to any existing rails application.
      Sure, there are plenty of paste-bin websites out there that support easy code-sharing. However, most often
      than not your code is proprietary intellectual property, and the last thing you want is to see it floating
      around on a public website. My <a href="https://kwbock.github.io/">friend</a> and I created Clipster for just
      that reason. Give your developers all the features of popular paste-bins while keeping the pastes behind your
      own security and protection measures. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/kwbock/clipster">Github</a>.

  <p>
    Filterable supplies a
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and
    <a href="https://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/">X-editable</a>
    themed per-column filter for an HTML table. Simply click a table column, type in a filter,
    and only rows matching your query will remain on screen. The jQuery plugin is complete with different options
    to control the look &amp; feel as well as supply your own matching function. The minimized version is built using
    <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, coding standards are forced using <a href="http://jshint.com/">JS Hint</a>,
    and over 70 unit tests are run using <a href="https://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a>.
    Check out the <a href="https://lightswitch05.github.io/filterable/">demo</a> or

  <h1><a href="https://github.com/lightswitch05/table-to-json">Table To JSON</a></h1>
  <p>
    Table To JSON is a jQuery plugin that converts
    an HTML Table into a javascript object. Obviously the need for such a plugin is not very common, but I needed it so here it is.
    This is mostly useful when parsing output from 3rd-party tools or legacy pages.
